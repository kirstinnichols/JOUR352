<p>Navient, a company specializing in loan management, has faced many lawsuits since 2017. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recorded complaints against the corporation since its founding, the number of complaints spiked significantly in 2017, jumping from 209 complaints in December 2016 to 3,888 complaints in January 2017. The complaint rates have since decreased, but still have remained in the mid 100s to mid 200s per month for the last two years. </p>

<br> 

<p>The majority of complaints against the company have to do with student loans, making up 29,980 of the 36,550 complaints against the corporation. Other notable complaint subjects are debt collection (3,679) and credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports, which make up 2,706 complaints.</p>

<h3>Navient responds to student loan complaints</h3>

<p>Of the complaints against Navient relating to student loans, the majority, 27,828, were responded to and closed with explanation. However, not many people received relief from their trouble with the company. Only 967 cases were closed with monetary relief, and 880 were closed with non-monetary relief. Company responses to consumer complaints seem to have decreased in quantity; right now, there is only one response in progress.</p>

<br>

<h3>Federal loan servicing makes up majority of student loan complaints</h3>

<p>Of those identified as student loan complaints, the majority (14,096) of complaints are about federal student loan servicing. This is followed by non-federal student loans, making up 10,318 of student loan complaints. Private student loans complaints were the minority at 5,576.</p>
