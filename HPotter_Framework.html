<p>Harry Potter is the best book/movie series. J.K. Rowling's attention to detail in setting, plot, and characters creates a world for readers to become immersed in. The plot is unique, interesting, and fast-paced, which keeps readers turning the pages. The characters are relatable in their values and vulnerability, but also spectacular in their bravery, adventures, and of course, magical powers. A reader can truly connect with these stories.</p>

<h3>Girl Power!</h3>

<p>There are also strong female characters in Harry Potter, which is always a big plus. Hermione is incredibly smart, brave, and fierce. Ginny is tough, athletic, and knows how to take charge in a chaotic situation. Luna is typically quite and passive but can be commanding when she wants to be. Bellatrix is one ofthe most powerful and effective villians in the series. Professor McGonagall is a graceful and intelligent leader who is both strict and caring. All are major characters in the story line, who make action happen rather than merely reacting to action.</p>

<h3>Here are some of my favorite moments in Harry Potter:</h3>

<div style="width:400px; color:#fff; background-color:#093EFA; padding:20px; text-align:left;">
<ul>
  <li>Harry meeting Hagrid
    <ul>
      <li>"Yer a wizard, Harry"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dobby being freed</li>
  <li>Harry and Sirius Black becoming friends</li>
  <li>Neville's speech</li>
  <li>Harry, Ron and Hermione sending their children to Hogwards together 19 years later</li>
  <ul>
    <li> (honestly gets me every time!)</li>
  </ul>
