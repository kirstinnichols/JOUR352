<p>New businesses in College Park, including a Trader Joe’s in an <a href="https://www.astercollegepark.com/">Aster apartment building</a> and a Shop Made in Maryland in the College Park City Hall, are projected to bring an increased quality of life to city residents this upcoming summer, according to College Park Economic Development Manager Michael Williams. 
</p>

<br>

<p>The newly built city hall and the opening of the two new Aster apartment buildings on Baltimore Avenue this summer represent new opportunities for business and community development, according to Williams. While Trader Joe’s will bring a wider variety of grocery options to the city, the Shop Made in Maryland will promote locally produced goods.</p>

<br>

<p>According to Williams, there are currently multiple Shop Made in DC and Shop Made in VA stores, and Shop Made in Maryland is an expansion of this business. These stores feature products such as food, jewelry, cards, original artworks, and candles, among other things. 
</p>

<br>

<p>“They [Shop Made in Maryland] have a footprint of what they like their stores to look like,” said Williams. “We provided them with $75,000 to make it match the decor of all the other shops.”</p>

<br>

<p>Stacey Price, the founder of the “Shop Made” chain, said that just like her other shops, this store will sell locally made items. While her other stores sell items made by D.C. and VA residents, this shop will only sell items made by Maryland creators.</p>

  <h5>“So, same mission, different makers,” said Price.

<p>Keeping in fashion with its D.C. counterparts, Shop Made in Maryland will also include a cafe with a coffee bar similar to that at The Roost, a D.C. restaurant. It will carry grab-and-go food, such as salads, soups, and sandwiches, according to Price.</p>

<br>

<p>Additionally, the space will hold taps with nitro cold brew, kombucha, beer, and cider as well as a curated wine menu.</p>

<br>

<p>This new city hall-based shop will also bring event opportunities such as art classes to College Park residents.</p>

<br>

<p>“The space will offer our signature programming, ‘Wine + Watercolors’ and ‘Sip + Paint,’ as well as other DIY instruction taught by Maryland makers,” said Price.</p>


<p>Williams said that this shop’s intended space in city hall is currently under construction, but is expected to open mid-summer, likely within a week of Trader Joe’s.</p>

<br>

<p>For Brooke Butler, a sophomore kinesiology major at UMD, a new Trader Joe’s is a game changer.</p>

<br>

<p>“It’s so hard to find the food I want at Target. Their selection is really limited,” said Butler.</p>

<br>

<p>Butler has tried to walk to Lidl for groceries in the past, but as a South Campus Commons resident, this 30-minute walk is especially difficult while carrying bags full of groceries.</p>

<br>

 <div class="callout primary">
  <h5>“I’m so excited for Trader Joe’s,” said Butler. “It will be a short and convenient walk, and I think it will have a better selection than anything else here.”
</h5>
</div>

<br>


<p>While a stroll across campus to grab some groceries at Trader Joe’s will be an easy feat for many, the process of bringing new developments to College Park is not so simple.</p>
 
 <br>

<div class="callout primary">
  <h5>“We have to dance with the developer and the builders because many times they go back to the permit process because they may figure out… they need more space, not less,” said Williams. “When you add on, let’s just say, 300 square feet to the floor plan, well, you gotta get permission to do that.”
</h5>
</div>

<br>

<p>Projects like these take a long time to move from paper onto a construction site. Those in charge of planning new developments need to gain permission from both College Park and Prince George’s County officials, according to Williams.</p>

<br>


<p>Although the development process can be tedious, new business may be key to maintaining a middle-aged population in College Park, according to Williams.</p>

<br>

<p>The city’s Annual Economic Development Report reveals that the 50-54 age group population in College Park decreased by 14% between 2016 and 2021. The 45-49 and 55-59 age group populations decreased at similar rates: 12% and 11%, respectively. However, Williams said he is pleased that more people in their late 20s and early 30s are moving to College Park, and wants to continue building this city into a home for all people, not just students.</p>


<br>


<p>Williams said he thinks that new business presences will help increase resident retention rates, and Shop Made in Maryland and Trader Joe’s are not the only businesses arriving in the area.</p> 

<br>

<p>Williams said he will soon announce plans for two new sit-down restaurants to open within The Hotel. Williams also said he is working to bring more coffee shops and a pancake house to the area, and speaks to restaurants about once a week.</p>

<br>

<p>A lot of developments still under construction are already leased out, according to Williams.</p>

<br>

<p>That’s how popular we are,” said Williams.</p>
